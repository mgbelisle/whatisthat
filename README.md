I am a programmer, and one of things I use frequently and understand fairly well is the concept of how to secure data so that only authorized parties can access it. That being the case, friends and family and strangers who are not programmers often ask me to explain things they hear in the news related to the following topics which are all somewhat related on different levels. I hope the info is understandable enough to shed some light on the subjects so readers can see the social implications of each one.
