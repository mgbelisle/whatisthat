# What is the DNS transfer?

There has been lots of talk about the US transfering the internet's DNS system to ICANN/IANA, some of it highly politicized like this:

Here are the facts along with my opinion.

The internet has a phone book type thing called DNS, you tell it a name (e.g. google.com) and it gives you the server's number/IP address (in this case 173.194.66.100). Whoever owns and manages the phone book has a fair amount of power because they can go in and delete for example google.com and then nobody could access Google unless they had the number memorized. This "phone book" has been owned by the Department of Commerce ever since its creation, and it has been managed by a California based non profit organization called IANA for the last twenty years or so. On September 30th ownership of the phone book will be transferred to IANA at which point disputes will be resolved by multinational group of stakeholders (including China and Russia) instead of just the Department of Commerce. The technical name for this is the IANA Stewardship Transition and here are the technical details:

Cruz's campaign is correct that this transition will give China and Russia partial influence over all the entries in the global phone book, and his proposal is to stop the transition of ownership. But he is incorrect that his proposal keeps it censorship free, because currently the US government does a lot of censorship in the name of protecting US interests and law, like [this](https://www.wired.com/2013/06/domains-seized/), [this](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110201/10252412910/homeland-security-seizes-spanish-domain-name-that-had-already-been-declared-legal.shtml), [this](https://pir.org/policies/org-idn-policies/takedown-policy/tdn_2013/), and [this](https://pir.org/policies/org-idn-policies/takedown-policy/tdn_2012/).

There is, however, an option to actually make the phone book one hundred percent impossible to censor, with a commonly used technology called digital signatures (more specifically [DotBit](https://bit.namecoin.info/)), but Cruz does not support that option, probably because he wants to keep the phone book censored for "good causes" by the US government only like it currently is. So there are three options really 1) censorship by a multinational group, 2) censorship by the US government only, or 3) impossible to censor. Obama supports #1 and Cruz supports #2 and I support #3 and as long as you know there are those three options I do not judge which one you support. If I had to choose between #1 and #2 then I would probably do #2 because we have a better censorship history than the average country. If #1 happens (which it probably will) and the world realizes it was a mistake, the world might eventually switch to #3 but probably not back to #2 in my opinion.
