# What is the dark web?

There is a subset of the internet that is widely referred to as the "dark web," but that is a loaded term in my opinion and I prefer to use the term "anonymity networks." The point of these networks is to provide anonymous sharing of online content, and they include networks like TOR, Freenet, and I2P which use strong encryption to keep users anonymous, whereas normal internet use is not anonymous for a number of technical reasons. There are of course legitimate uses and illegitimate uses of these networks, but since the media focuses on the illegitimate ones I would like to explain both:

## Do bad things happen on the anonymity networks?

Yes. Astonishingly bad things happen on these networks, unfortunately. You can order a kilo of cocain to your doorstep as if it were amazon.com, and you can buy ten thousand stolen credit card numbers, or ten thousand counterfeit bills from a seller with a five star rating. You can radicalize a suicide bomber or hire a hitman. To say all of these things are terrible is an understatement.

## Do good things happen on the anonymity networks?

Yes. Human rights activists report government atrocities. FBI agents track down ISIS cells. Whistleblowers expose political leaders doing offshore tax evasion. All of these people need anonymity to avoid retaliation from the entities they seek justice against.

Whether you agree or disagree with the existence of these networks, the important thing to understand is that they an all or nothing proposition. Anonymity is anonymity whether it is for Hitler or Mother Teresa, and you cannot eliminate one without eliminating both.
