# What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a digital currency, like the US dollar or the British Pound, except it is more like gold than a dollar. It is based on a computer's proof that it has done a certain amount of computation via encryption. It is in my opinion a revolutionary concept that fulfills its claim of having the following characteristics, even though it is mysterious to most people.

* Impossible to counterfeit (like gold, you can test if gold is gold)
* Impossible to inflate (like gold, you can't print one million new pounds of it)
* Easy to exchange (like gold or cash, I can give you some and you can give me some, no middle man needed)

It has been around since 2009. Here are the most common questions I get asked about bitcoin:

## Who decides a bitcoin's value?

Just like gold, the market decides the value of a bitcoin, aka people's willingness to trade it for X. The value has been highly volatile since its beginning as people's perception of it changes (today, July 20th 2016, you can exhange one bitcoin for $667), but that volatility will probably steady itself out over time as it becomes more and more well known and used.

## What government is in charge of bitcoin?

Just like gold, there is no government in charge of bitcoin. Its value will collapse if the whole internet dies or if people abandon it, but it will not collapse if some government does.

## Who invented bitcoin?

In October 2008, the idea of bitcoin was sent to the world by an anonymous individual who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto, and to this day his identity is unknown despite many attempts to discover it. He emailed a nine page academic paper to the world's leading cryptographers in which he explained the idea of bitcoin and posted the computer source code necessary to run it.

Then, over the next couple years he helped them setup the network until it was running well, and then he just disappeared. There have been many guesses about his identity but most of them have been proveably wrong, and it is likely that his identity will never be uncovered.

## Is bitcoin anti-government?

No. Even if the very extreme were to happen that the American people abandoned the dollar in place of bitcoin, there are many effective governments that operate on currency issued by someone else, like Germany or the State of Montana or the City of Boonville Missouri. They are just as legitimate, they still collect taxes, prosecute criminals, etc. without issuing their own currency.

But in the US, our leaders all swear to uphold and defend the Consitution so what it has to say about currency is important to us. It says:

[Article 1 Section 8 and 10](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html)

> Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes ... To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;

> No State shall ... coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts;

And that is fine. The US can still issue its US dollar, states cannot issue their own currencies, and both bitcoins and dollars can be exchanged for gold or silver so I see no fundamental problem there.

One reason that people blame bitcoin for being anti-government is because there are criminal groups that find it useful. This is very true, but it is in my opinion a weak and ill informed view of what it means for something to be anti-government. Paper shreaders, matches, cars, shovels, and cash are all "anti-government." Criminals shread their paperwork, they light things on fire, drive to their criminal activities, bury corpses, and pay with cash, but does this mean that we should outlaw or even regulate the shreaders, matches, cars, shovels, and cash they used for those things? No, of course not. Blaming bitcoin for the online black market (called the dark web) is like blaming Exon gas stations for the string of arsons in Kentucky last month.

Another reason why people blame bitcoin for being anti-government is because they think it is *entirely anonymous*. People take this claim very far, sometimes arguing that bitcoin was designed specifically for criminal activities because of its anonymity. This is in my opinion another ill informed view that is easily cleared up when you look at the technical details. All bitcoin transactions are stored visibly, traceably, and permanently in the bitcoin public ledger. This means that you can see every time which bitcoin address paid which other bitcoin address exactly how many bitcoins. That provides an unprecedented level of transparency to the currency, but "anonymous" payments are still possible if you want to do them by making a new address for each transaction. If you never reveal the fact that you own that address e.g. `1FNNY51HzjkSEkNt7yJ7pkwrxNbgJiGHxN` then no one will know it was you. So the bottom line is that some bitcoin payments are anonymous, but some are not, and it depends what the user wants.

## Is bitcoin a good investment?

No. When bitcoin's value jumped from ~$25 to ~$1100 dollars per bitcoin in 2013, people started thinking that it was a good investment, but unfortunately it is not. Long term high risk stock portfolios are a good investment; bitcoin is a currency, a particularly volatile one right now, and is not a good investment.

## How do you create bitcoins?

A bitcoin is created when any computer on the bitcoin network finds the numeric solution to an extremely difficult math problem, and the bitcoin is awarded to that computer when it announces the solution to the network. The math problem is called a cryptographic hash, and the most important characteristic of a hash is that it is 1) very hard to calculate, and 2) very easy to verify. For explanatory purposes, it is like I give you a pencil and paper and say `Find the prime factors of 23792243`. No matter how talented at math you are, it would take months or years to find that the solution is `367 * 269 * 241` but then it would take just a few minutes for anyone else with a pencil and paper to verify that is correct `367 * 269 * 241 = 23792243`.  The difficulty of the math problems are adjusted by the bitcoin network so that bitcoin supply roughly approximates the world wide supply of gold over the centuries.
