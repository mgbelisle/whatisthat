# What is encryption?

Encryption is when you have data, like `The dog ate my pizza`, and with some fancy math turn it into ciphertext, like this, which can only be read by someone who has a special key.

```

In this case the key was ``5EScJ'xM@1ABa5'Olm1*)`;98l:f~l-K``, and with that key you can decrypt the ciphertext back into the original plaintext `The dog ate my pizza`. The important part is that the data *cannot* be read without the key, and even a key that short is too big for anyone to guess. No matter how much computation you do, even if you ran all the supercomputers in the world for several years, it wouldn't even come close to guessing the key. This is called *strong encryption* and has existed for a couple decades now, and it means that people without the key cannot read the data, which means *theives cannot read it* and *governments cannot read it*.

That second point is what has brought the topic of encryption into the news, because governments do not like it when they want to read something, but cannot, because of math. It becomes very painful some times, like when a convicted murderer's hard disk contains possible evidence exposing other murderers' identities, and the police cannot read the disk because it is encrypted and the owner is dead. The judges and politicians involved in such cases have been fighting against the existence of strong encryption, and hopefully everyone can see why, because sometimes it hurts. What the news media and the policitians usually fail to explain is that every day in millions of instances, strong encryption protects your data from other less lawful parties who would like to read it. Every bank account, credit card number, medical record, and personal email is or should be protected by strong encryption. You cannot have digital security which blocks a thief but somehow does not block the government, and that is not because of any laws, it is because that is the way math works.

## What went on with the San Bernadino shooter's iPhone?

The San Bernadino shooter's iPhone event was an interesting case with lots of nuances, but the important parts to know was that the shooter's iPhone was an old model with relativlely weak encryption (model 5C with a four digit guessable pin instead of a 256 bit unguessable key which the newer iPhones have), which is why the FBI was able to pay some specialists $1.3 million to crack it. Apple's response that they would not crack it was a good one in my opinion, because they were not only legitimately protecting their customers from identity thieves who would steal the government's "back door", but also because legal requests to crack into the current generation of iPhones under the same circumstances are not possible even for Apple.
